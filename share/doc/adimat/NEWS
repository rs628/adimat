New feature list of ADiMat.

Most recent adds occur first in the list.

Version 0.5.6
- Support for compressed Jacobian computation with CPR coloring
- Separation into client+runtime environment and transformation server
- High level interface commands: admDiffFor, admDiffRev
- New forward mode (vector mode without classes): admDiffVFor. Works 
  with Octave.

Version 0.5.5
- Several stack implementations for functions push and pop in the
  reverse mode code.

Version 0.5.4
- First order reverse mode, using function or command admrev
- Adjoint classes "scalar" or "default", which uses the current
  derivative class.
- Basic support for differentiation calls to function handles.

Version 0.5
- Several derivative classes, including sparse derivative storage.

Version 0.3
- Windows support (standalone no libraries needed)
- Windows setup with automatic integration into MATLAB
- processing non driver files, i.e., process function files directly
  (funcmode)
- enable listing of in-/dependent variables on command-line, if in funcmode
- ADiMat call directly from MATLAB (implementing addiff())

Version 0.2
- forward AD Hessian computation
- scalar constant folding
- narg(in|out) mapper generation
- vararg(in|out) handling and mapper generation (incomplete, beta)

Version 0.1
- forward AD (1st order derivatives)
- automatic file lookup
- built-ins database
- code canonicalization
- calltree construction (and export)
- variable dependency analyse (and export)
- optimized operators to save loops
- local common subexpression elimination
- global common subexpression elimination (deactivated by default, 
  semi-functional)
- detect overwriting of variables and prevent it
