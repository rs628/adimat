function [g_p, p] = partial_legendre(n,x,normalize)
%PARTIAL_LEGENDRE  Compressed local partial derivative of legendre.
%
%   [G_P,P] = PARTIAL_LEGENDRE(N,X,NORMALIZE) evaluates the local partial
%   derivatives of the function
%         P = legendre(N,X,NORMALIZE)
%   with respect to X. Here, N is the degree of the associated Legendre
%   functions and X is the point at which which legendre() and its
%   derivatives are evaluated. More precisely, PARTIAL_LEGENDRE returns the
%   following:
%     (a) P = legendre(N,X,NORMALIZE)
%     (b) G_P is the local Jacobian of legendre() wrt to X stored in a
%         compressed form as described below.
%   All three normalization schemes specified by the optional parameter
%   NORMALIZE are supported. As in legendre(), the default normalization is
%   given by NORMALIZE = 'unnorm'. See the help of legendre() for more
%   information.
%
%   The local Jacobian of legendre() is a sparse (N+1)L-by-L matrix, where
%   L is the number of elements stored in X. Its particular structure is as
%   follows: Every column consists of at most N+1 nonzero elements. This is
%   exploited by storing the nonzeros of the sparse Jacobian in a matrix of
%   size (N+1)-by-L. This compressed form G_P of the local Jacobian is
%   small and dense.
%
%   Let M = 0, 1, ..., N denote the order of the associated Legendre
%   functions of degree N.
%   If X is a vector with L = length(X), then we have for
%   a) the original function: P is an (N+1)-by-L matrix.
%      The P(M+1,i) entry corresponds to the associated Legendre function
%      of degree N and order M evaluated at X(i).
%   b) the derivative: G_P is also an (N+1)-by-L matrix.
%      The G_P(M+1,i) entry corresponds to the derivative of P(M+1,i) with
%      respect to X(i) evaluated at X(i).
%
%   In general, the returned array has one more dimension than X.
%   Each element P(M+1,i,j,k,...) contains the associated Legendre
%   function of degree N and order M evaluated at X(i,j,k,...). The
%   derivatives G_P(M+1,i,j,k,...) correspond to the derivative of
%   P(M+1,i,j,k,...) with respect to X(i,j,k,...) evaluated at
%   X(i,j,k,...).

%   03/29/2016: Handling of boundaries x=+1 and x=-1 added.
%
%   Implementation notes:
%   The implementation is based on the following recurrence formula:
%   (1-x*x) (d P^m_n(x) / d x) = - n x P^m_n(x) + (n+m) P^m_{n-1}(x)
%
%   The current implementation loops over the degree m and then checks for
%   the degree n. However, it may not be a bad idea to handle the case n==0
%   separately at the beginning. This would simplify the coding and
%   increase the readability of the implementation.

% Check on points of non-differentiability

% If we introduce a more rigorous system to cope with points of
% nondifferentiability in the future, we might want to know the indices
% where x=1 or x=-1. We could then use something similar to
%  if any(find( abs(x-1)<tol | abs(x+1)<tol ))
if max(abs(x(:))) >= 1
